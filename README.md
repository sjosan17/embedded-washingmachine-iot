This is a Photon which is connected up to five push-buttons and one 16x2 LCD screen with integrated IC2(AiSquaredCee). When a person who put a wash on, have to do one more step, and that is pushing on his/her name. This will make the LCD screen switch to the persons name and its washing. Everyone using the washinmachine gets a warning on email that a wash has started.

After three hours the LCD screen will switch from washing to "finished." Those who are on the email service will get a new email stating that the machine is done. Now the next person can go and wash their cloths.
